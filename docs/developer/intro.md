# Developer Documentation

Welcome to the Developer Documentation for our platform. This section provides comprehensive resources for developers who want to integrate with our services, build extensions, or create custom implementations.

## What's Inside

Our developer documentation is divided into several key sections:

- **API Reference**: Detailed documentation of our RESTful API endpoints
- **Authentication**: Guide to implementing authentication with Clerk
- **Webhooks**: Set up and manage webhooks for real-time data updates
- **SDKs**: Client libraries for various programming languages
- **Examples**: Sample code and implementation guides
